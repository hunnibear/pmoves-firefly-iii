# It's not you, it's me

Many bugs reported to Firefly III are in fact configuration and system problems on the user side ü§∑. Bugs are rarely actually bugs.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't login
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't register first account
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 500 error when starting Firefly III
- ‚ö†Ô∏è White page when starting Firefly III
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Time-out when starting Firefly III
