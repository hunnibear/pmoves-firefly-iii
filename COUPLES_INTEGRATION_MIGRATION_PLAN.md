### Legacy Phase Plans (Originally Planned - Now Superseded by Phase 2)

~~#### Step 4: Docker Configuration Migration~~ **SUPERSEDED**
~~#### Step 5: Supabase Integration~~ **SUPERSEDED** 
~~#### Step 6: Environment Configuration~~ **SUPERSEDED**

*Note: These steps were originally planned but are no longer needed since Phase 1 successfully integrated all infrastructure components.*

~~### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement & Testing (Steps 7-9)~~ **SUPERSEDED**
~~#### Step 7: Feature Gap Analysis~~ **SUPERSEDED**

#### Step 8: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for CouplesController
- [ ] Create integration tests for couples features
- [ ] Test Docker deployment end-to-end
- [ ] Create testing documentation and procedures

#### Step 9: Security & Performance Review
- [ ] Security audit of couples integration
- [ ] Performance testing of new features
- [ ] Review and update security templates
- [ ] Document security considerations

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (Steps 10-12)
**Goal**: Complete documentation and prepare for production

#### Step 10: Complete Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive couples integration guide
- [ ] Update README with couples features
- [ ] Create API documentation for couples endpoints
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

#### Step 11: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create deployment checklist
- [ ] Test production deployment scenario
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Document monitoring and maintenance

#### Step 12: Repository Cleanup
- [ ] Archive pmoves-budgapp appropriately
- [ ] Clean up unnecessary files
- [ ] Update repository descriptions
- [ ] Create final migration summary

## Context Window Management Strategy

### Approach 1: Phase-by-Phase Execution
- Execute one phase completely before moving to next
- Each phase designed to fit within context window
- Document outputs between phases for reference

### Approach 2: Component-Focused Sessions
- Focus on one component per session (Docker, Supabase, etc.)
- Create detailed documentation for each component
- Reference documentation in subsequent sessions

### Approach 3: Test-Driven Development
- Create tests first, then implement changes
- Use test results to validate migration success
- Maintain test documentation as context reference

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Create full backup of pmoves-firefly-iii before migration
- [ ] Tag current state for easy rollback
- [ ] Maintain pmoves-budgapp as fallback reference

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Incremental testing at each step
- [ ] Automated testing where possible
- [ ] Manual testing checklist for critical paths

### Documentation Strategy
- [ ] Document all changes and decisions
- [ ] Create decision log for architectural choices
- [ ] Maintain troubleshooting knowledge base

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All couples features working in Firefly III integration
- [ ] Docker deployment successful
- [ ] Supabase integration functional
- [ ] No regression in existing Firefly III features

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Complete documentation for future development
- [ ] Test coverage for couples features
- [ ] Security compliance maintained
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Choose execution approach (Phase-by-Phase recommended)
2. **Short-term**: Begin Phase 1 - Documentation & Analysis
3. **Medium-term**: Execute Phases 2-3 with careful testing
4. **Long-term**: Complete Phase 4 and deploy to production

## Communication Plan

- Document progress after each step
- Create summary reports for each phase
- Maintain changelog of all modifications
- Update this plan as needed based on discoveries

**Note**: This plan is designed to be executed incrementally to manage context window limitations while ensuring comprehensive migration and testing.
