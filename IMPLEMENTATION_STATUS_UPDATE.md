## 🔄 **Integration Points Prepared**

### **LangExtract Service Integration**
```python
# Ready for implementation:
RECEIPT_SCHEMA = {
    "merchant": "string",
    "amount": "number", 
    "date": "date",
    "category": "string",
    "items": "array",
    "tax_amount": "number",
    "payment_method": "string"
}
```

### **Supabase Real-time Schema**
```sql
-- Prepared for real-time features:
CREATE TABLE couples_realtime_events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    couples_profile_id INTEGER,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    event_data JSONB,
    created_by INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Enhanced Dashboard Data Flow**
```
User Upload → Backend Processing → LangExtract → AI Enhancement → Real-time Update → Partner Notification
```

## 📋 **Next Implementation Steps**

### **Phase 1: LangExtract Integration (Weeks 1-2)**
1. Set up LangExtract service with Ollama
2. Replace mock responses with actual LangExtract processing
3. Implement receipt processing pipeline
4. Add confidence scoring and manual override

### **Phase 2: Supabase Real-time (Weeks 3-4)**  
1. Configure Supabase real-time subscriptions
