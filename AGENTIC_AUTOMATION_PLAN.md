- Bank statement processing and transaction extraction
- Receipt scanning and expense categorization

#### 2. Transaction Intelligence Agent
**Purpose**: Real-time transaction analysis and enhancement
**Components**:
- Webhook listener for transaction events
- AI categorization using existing LangExtract service
- Automatic rule application and learning
- Anomaly detection and alerts

#### 3. Financial Planning Agent
**Purpose**: Autonomous budget management and forecasting
**Components**:

### Integration Strategy

#### Webhook-Based Event Processing
```json
{
  "trigger": "TRIGGER_STORE_TRANSACTION",
  "response": "RESPONSE_TRANSACTIONS",
  "content": {
    "transactions": [...]
  }
}
```

#### API Authentication Flow
- Generate Personal Access Token from `/profile` page
- Use Bearer token authentication for API requests
- Implement OAuth2 flow for production deployments

#### Rule Engine Integration
- Leverage existing rule triggers and actions
