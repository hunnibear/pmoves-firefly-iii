## About

"Firefly III" is a financial manager. It can help you keep track of expenses, income, budgets and everything in between. It even supports credit cards, shared 
household accounts and savings accounts! It's pretty fancy. The end goal is to save money.
 
Firefly is a system you'll have install yourself on webhosting of your choosing.

Personal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people
make budgets, other people limit their cashflow by throwing away their credit cards, others get a better job.
There are tons of ways to save and earn money.
